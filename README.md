# Investigating_COVID-19_Virus_Trends
In this Project, I use a dataset, from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lin0li/covid19testing . This dataset was collected between the 20th of January and the 1st of June 2020. My analysis tries to provide an answer to the question: Which countries have reported the highest number of positive cases in relation to the number of tests conducted?
